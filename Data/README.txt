This data set is change compared to the origional dataset.
The changes has been made to make it easier to handle the data in matlab.
The following changes has been made:
	* We have added an ID field to every observation s.t. we can easily distinguis between the observations
	* The dataset was "split" in two different regions, we have concatenated the data and know that at line 123(in the csv file) the other region begins.
